/**
 * JavaScript Type Guards - Foundation Layer
 *
 * Pure type detection functions with zero dependencies.
 * Used by both memimg (serialization) and navigator (UI).
 *
 * CRITICAL: This module MUST NOT import from memimg, navigator, or metadata.
 *
 * Design Principles:
 * - Zero dependencies (pure functions only)
 * - Single source of truth for type detection
 * - Exhaustive testing (100% coverage)
 * - Type-safe guards where applicable

// Placeholder - will be populated in subsequent checkpoints
// Functions will be added via TDD: tests first, then implementation
